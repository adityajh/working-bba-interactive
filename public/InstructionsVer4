# Working BBA Interactive Brochure — Precision Modification Spec (v1.1)

## A. Scope and Non-Goals

### A1. In scope
1. Convert the app framing from “tracks” → **three separate programs**, plus “How It Works.”
2. Add **Parent/Student toggle** (persistent).
3. Add **fear-first hero** per program (before curriculum content).
4. Standardize **cards** so *every activity* in every year uses the same scannable “Delta Card” system (common + program-specific).
5. Replace “Curriculum Operating System” tab with **How It Works** page (content rules below).
6. Add **Portfolio Section (Section 9)** with the provided image placement map (keep existing images too).
7. CTAs become **contextual** by section + toggle state.
8. Remove PSO codes from external-facing content (except internal-only structures if you keep them under the hood).

### A2. Out of scope (explicitly)
- No major visual redesign beyond components required (toggle, hero, cards, portfolio section, CTA system).
- No removal of existing images; only **add** and **reposition** while preserving current imagery.

# B. Architecture Changes (JSX-Level)

## B1. Rename “track” to “program” everywhere in UI
### Where to change in current JSX
- `TrackView` component → rename to `ProgramView`
- `trackData` object → rename to `programData`
- `track` prop → rename to `programKey`

### UI string changes (exact)
- Tabs:
  - “Working BBA for Entrepreneurial Jobs” → **“Working BBA — Entrepreneurial Jobs”**
  - “Working BBA for Business Families” → **“Working BBA — Business Families”**
  - “Working BBA for Venture Starters” → **“Working BBA — Venture Starters”**
  - “Curriculum Operating System” → **“How It Works”**
- Pills and section labels:
  - “Track-specific focus” → **“Program focus”**
  - “Track Summary Highlight” → **“Program Summary Highlight”** (alt text)
  - Any `track === ...` logic in headings should output “Program” phrasing.

**Acceptance test:** Search for “Track”, “track”, “Track-specific” in repo: **0 user-facing occurrences** remain.

---

# C. Global Persistent UI (All Tabs)

## C1. Parent/Student toggle (persistent, top-right)
### State
Add:
- `const [audience, setAudience] = useState('parent'); // 'parent' | 'student'`

Default = `'parent'`.

### Component
Pill switch, not dropdown. Example UI:
- `[ 👨‍👩‍👧 For Parents ] [ 🎓 For Students ]`
- Active option appears filled; inactive outlined.

### Behavior
- Switching toggle **must not** change `activeTab`.
- Only content elements listed in Section D change; everything else stays.

**Acceptance test:** Toggle changes copy/visibility in-place with no navigation.

---

## C2. Bottom “Hero banner footer” (persistent)
### Requirement
Add a visually prominent banner at the bottom of **every tab** (including How It Works):

> “Students graduate with a portfolio, references, and real work experience — not just a marksheet.”

### Implementation detail
- Not the small `pt-note` currently used; replace / upgrade it into a true banner.
- Use contrasting background; larger type; “single most important line.”

**Acceptance test:** Always visible after scrolling to bottom; consistent styling across tabs.

---

# D. Audience Toggle Content Rules (Exact)

Only these items change by toggle:

## D1. Program page hero subtitle + Year intros (copy switch)
Create helper:
- `copy.programHeroSub[programKey][audience]`
- `copy.yearIntro[yearNumber][audience]`

Use your provided text *verbatim* (from your doc).

## D2. Show/hide components by toggle
Implement `audienceVisibility` flags:

**Visible only for Parent**
- Accountability Promise section (Section H)
- “What parents receive” details (expanded tracking lists)
- Parent quote (social proof)

**Visible only for Student**
- Student before/after quote (full)
- “Peer/community proof quotes” (if you add)

**Visible for both, but shorter for Student**
- Competitive comparison section (How It Works page) → student version uses same table but less preamble + smaller emphasis.
- Progress tracking → student uses brief version.

**Acceptance test:** Student toggle does **not** show Accountability Promise CTA.

---

# E. Program Tabs & Top Hero (Already Present, refine)

## E1. Top hero (above tabs)
Already present in your JSX:
- Headline, subhead, chips, IMG_1

Keep structure but ensure copy matches:
- Headline: “India’s First Working BBA”
- Subhead: “Work is the Curriculum...”
- Chips remain 3.

No additional changes required except ensuring typography/spacing consistent across dark/light.

---

# F. Program Page Structure (All 3 Programs)

You want the same page skeleton for all 3 program tabs. Implement this standardized layout **in `ProgramView`**:

**Order (must match):**
1. Fear-first hero statement (audience variant)
2. Myth vs Reality block (NEW for EJ, FAM; refined for VEN)
3. “Best For” line
4. Year 1 — Common Foundation (with 9 Challenges grid + common core cards)
5. Portfolio After Year 1 (Section I) — uses the new images
6. Year 2 — Common Core + Program Focus
7. Year 3 — Deep Specialisation
8. What You Graduate With (3-column output summary)
9. Accountability Promise (Parent only)
10. Social proof (toggle rules)
11. Section CTA (contextual)
12. Persistent footer banner (global)

**Acceptance test:** EJ/FAM pages include Myth vs Reality before Year 1 (currently only VEN has it).

---

# G. Delta Card Standardization (Critical Implementation)

## G1. Replace legacy “capstone delta cards” with universal activity cards
Currently, you have:
- Year sections with “What they do / submit / feedback”
- Plus “CAPSTONE ACTIVITIES YEAR X” cards from `current.y1/y2/y3`

New requirement: **Every activity is a card**, for **all years**, including common core.

### Implementation approach
1. Create a unified schema:

activity: {
  title,
  duration,
  description,
  badge: 'All programs' | 'Entrepreneurial Jobs' | 'Business Families' | 'Venture Starters',
  category: 'Common' | 'ProgramSpecific'
}

2. Build arrays per year:
- `year1.commonActivities[]`
- `year2.commonActivities[]`
- `year2.programActivities[]`
- `year3.commonActivities[]`
- `year3.programActivities[]`

3. Render:
- A single `ActivityCard` component (replaces `pt-card` delta style).
- Color coding:
  - Common Core = Color A
  - Program-specific = Color B
  - Include label text: **“All programs”** vs **“Entrepreneurial Jobs only”** etc.

### Explicit deletions
- Remove “CAPSTONE ACTIVITIES YEAR 1/2/3” as a separate concept.
- Remove reliance on `y1/y2/y3` legacy arrays for display (they can be mapped into the new schema if you want).

**Acceptance test:** In Year 1, every item listed in your spec (9 challenges, client projects, first apprenticeship, skill tracks, camp, coaching, storytelling, reflection, networking week) appears as cards.

---

# H. Data Corrections (Must Fix From Current PDF/App)

These are present in the current EJ content/PDF and must be corrected:

1. Remove salary claim “₹8-12L starting salary” and replace with:
   - “Targeted placement in business operations, project management, and marketing roles at growth-stage companies.”  
   (This incorrect claim is visible in current PDF export.) fileciteturn0file3

2. Year 1 is 100% common core:
   - Delete/replace EJ Year 1 “Manage client projects for 2-3 growing companies” framing that implies ongoing management.  
   (This line appears in current app/PDF Year 1 “WHAT THEY DO”.) fileciteturn0file3

3. “50+ customer interviews” is **VEN Year 2 focus**, not Year 1.

4. Apprenticeship naming:
   - Always use **“Mentored Apprenticeship”** (not “Apprenticeship”).

5. Replace “Mentor” vs “Coach” inconsistency:
   - Role label = **Coach** (professional role), “mentor” only informally.

---

# I. New Components (Precise Specs)

## I1. Myth vs Reality block
### Where
Immediately after Fear-first hero (all 3 programs).

### What
- EJ and FAM: new tables exactly as provided.
- VEN: keep structure, update text as provided.

### Styling
Use the same `pt-mythReality` layout you already have for VEN:
- Left column “Myth”
- Right column “Reality”

**Acceptance test:** EJ/FAM now have myth/reality; VEN text updated.

---

## I2. Accountability Promise section
### Where
- On each program page: after “What You Graduate With” (Parent only)
- On How It Works page: always visible

### Content
Use your timeline copy as-is (Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly/6 months + “If standards aren’t met”).

### CTA after
Parent only:
- “See an actual student dashboard”

**Acceptance test:** Hidden on student toggle in program pages; visible on How It Works for both.

---

## I3. Sample Portfolio After Year 1 (Section 9)
### Where
- On each program page: immediately after Year 1 section.
- Also add a linkable anchor from How It Works → Evidence/Portfolio section.

### Layout (exact)
1. HERO full-width image: `portfolio-messy-desk-evidence.png`
2. Three rows of 2 cards (desktop), stacked (mobile):
   - Row 1: client pitch room (L) + whiteboard brainstorm (R)
   - Row 2: reference letter (L) + daily cards stack (R)
   - Row 3: storysells stage (L) + jury saturday (R)
3. Closing full-width image: `portfolio-apprenticeship-workspace.png`

### Captions
Use your captions verbatim.

### Behavior
- Keep images “photo essay” style.
- Optional hover zoom is allowed but must be subtle.

**Acceptance test:** Images load without replacing/removing existing IMG_2…IMG_7 assets.

---

## I4. 9 Challenges grid (Year 1, Common Foundation)
### Where
Inside Year 1 section, before other Year 1 common-core cards.

### Display rules
- Desktop: 3×3 grid
- Mobile: vertical list or carousel

Each card shows:
- Number 01–09
- Challenge Name (bold)
- Subtitle
- Expand/collapse description on tap/hover

**Acceptance test:** Users can scan all 9 challenges without reading dense paragraphs.

---

# J. How It Works Page (Tab 4) — Content Rules

## J1. Rename tab + remove jargon
Tab label: **How It Works**
Page must **not** show:
- periodic table
- element codes
- PSO codes
- “container / pillar / artifact / cycle”

## J2. Page structure (must match)
1. Page hero (audience copy variant)
2. “Six things your child will be able to do by graduation” (6 cards)
3. “What a Typical Week Looks Like” (3 schedule tabs/carousel)
4. Accountability Promise (same component)
5. Competitive comparison table
6. “What your child graduates with” (proof summary)
7. Social proof (3 quotes)
8. CTA
9. Persistent footer banner

## J3. What to do with existing OPS content in JSX
Right now `activeTab === 'periodic'` renders:
- OS explainer
- PSO grid (pso1..pso6) that opens modal
- heavy “how to read system” table explanations
- legend blocks

**Instruction (precise):**
- Keep the `elements` dataset and `ElementModal` code only if you still need it internally, **but do not render it on How It Works**.
- Replace the whole periodic table UI with the new How It Works page content above.

**Acceptance test:** No PSO buttons visible on How It Works page.

---

# K. Social Proof (Toggle Rules)

## K1. Placement
- Program pages: show 1 quote after “What You Graduate With”
- How It Works: show all 3

## K2. Toggle logic
- Parent quote: parent only
- Student before/after: student only (parent sees only “After” line if you want)
- Employer quote: both

---

# L. Contextual CTA System (Behavior + Copy)

## L1. Behavior
All CTAs go to one URL (config constant):
- `const CTA_URL = '…' // placeholder`

## L2. Copy map (exact)
Use your table from Section 13 (Parent/Student variants). Implement via:
- `getCtaCopy(sectionKey, audience)`

## L3. Placement rule
After each “major section”:
- Year 1
- Year 2
- Year 3 / Outcomes
- Accountability (where visible)
- Portfolio section
- Comparison
- Social proof
- Page bottom

**Acceptance test:** Same destination; copy varies correctly.

---

# M. Keep Existing Images (Explicit)

## M1. Preserve existing assets
Do not remove:
- `/IMG_1.png` (header)
- `/IMG_2.png` `/IMG_3.png` `/IMG_4.png` (program images y1)
- `/IMG_5.png` `/IMG_6.png` `/IMG_7.png` (program end images)
- Logo image

## M2. Add new portfolio images
Add the Section 9 images using your placement map exactly.

---

## Quick Notes Where Your Current Code Conflicts With New Strategy (So Devs Don’t Miss It)

- `TrackView` currently uses **different Year 1 content per track**, even though you want Year 1 fully common. This must be refactored: Year 1 content should come from a single common dataset, not `programData[programKey].year1Content`.
- VEN currently says “Continued non-performance results in program track change” — must become **program adjustment** language (and avoid “track change” entirely).
- OPS tab currently renders PSOs and periodic table; new How It Works must be plain-language cards and schedules.
