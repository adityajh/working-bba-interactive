## 1) Fear-first hero statements (EJ / FAM / VEN)

**One per program with Parent + Student variants**

### EJ — Working BBA for Entrepreneurial Jobs

**Parent variant:**
Your child will graduate with a degree. But without real work pressure, they still won’t be “work-ready.”
This program forces deadlines, manager feedback, and real delivery—before graduation.

**Student variant:**
If you’re scared you won’t survive a real job… good.
You’ll build work confidence the only way it’s built: doing real work under real deadlines.

---

### FAM — Working BBA for Business Families

**Parent variant:**
A family business doesn’t need “ideas.” It needs reliability.
This program trains your child to show up, follow through, communicate professionally, and earn responsibility.

**Student variant:**
If you want respect inside your own family business, you need proof—not excuses.
You’ll build trust by delivering, communicating, and handling responsibility like an adult.

---

### VEN — Working BBA for Venture Starters

**Parent variant:**
Most “startup kids” love ideas and hate execution. That becomes expensive.
This program builds a disciplined founder: customers, deadlines, systems, repeatability.

**Student variant:**
If you want to start a venture, you don’t need motivation. You need output.
Here, you ship every week—customers, feedback, and uncomfortable truth included.

## 2) Myth vs Reality tables (EJ + FAM)

### EJ — Entrepreneurial Jobs

| Myth                               | Reality                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “A BBA makes you job-ready.”       | Job readiness comes from deadlines, managers, and delivery.         |
| “Confidence comes from knowledge.” | Confidence comes from shipping work and being evaluated.            |
| “Internships are enough.”          | Apprenticeships + client projects build real reliability and proof. |
| “Marks show capability.”           | Portfolio + feedback + references show capability.                  |

### FAM — Business Families

| Myth                                     | Reality                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “They’ll learn inside our business.”     | Without baseline maturity, they become a burden, not an asset.                          |
| “They’ll become responsible over time.”  | Responsibility is trained through commitments, follow-through, and feedback loops.      |
| “Business needs ‘big ideas’ from youth.” | Business first needs discipline: punctuality, communication, ownership, decision logic. |
| “We just need them to join.”             | You need them to be handover-ready: trusted, consistent, and professional.              |

## 3) “How It Works” page content

Includes: 6 capability cards, typical week schedule, comparison table, social proof quotes.

### A) 6 Capability Cards (Antigravity-ready)

**1) Work Discipline**
Students build adult habits: punctuality, follow-through, hygiene, and weekly delivery.
Not vibes. Not motivation. Output.

**2) Communication Under Pressure**
Updates, follow-ups, presentations, stakeholder calls—done repeatedly.
They learn to speak clearly even when nervous.

**3) Real Business Execution**
Sales, operations, research, basic finance thinking, and structured problem-solving—done through challenges and real projects.

**4) Proof-Based Portfolio**
Everything is documented: docs, media, testimonials, feedback scores, and project outcomes.
Proof beats potential.

**5) Feedback Loops (Not Exams)**
Assessment happens through supervisors, clients, peers, facilitators—and real deliverables.
They improve by being evaluated, not by cramming.

**6) Career Clarity Through Work**
Students don’t “choose” blindly. They experience roles, environments, and expectations—then decide with evidence.

---

### B) Typical Week Schedule

**Monday to Friday:** 10:00 AM – 5:00 PM
**Saturday:** 10:00 AM – 1:00 PM (student presentations + reviews)

**What that means in practice:**

* A structured weekly rhythm
* Regular presentations and feedback loops
* A culture of showing work, not just talking about it

### C) Comparison Table

| Feature           | Working BBA (LE)                    | Typical BBA                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Curriculum        | Work + challenges + projects        | Mostly classroom theory      |
| Proof             | Portfolio + feedback + references   | Marksheets + exams           |
| Accountability    | Deadlines + reviews + delivery      | Attendance + exams           |
| Skill-building    | Repetition under real pressure      | Limited real output cycles   |
| Parent visibility | Ongoing evidence + progress signals | Syllabus + grades            |
| Outcome           | Work-ready capability               | Degree + uncertain readiness |

### D) Social proof quotes (use as rotating chips / blocks)

* (Y2) “I used to wait for instructions. Now I just start.”

* (Y3) “Deadlines changed me. I don’t like it… but I needed it.”
* (Y3) “I still get nervous. I just do it anyway.”
* (Y2/Y3) “My parents stopped asking ‘what are you studying?’ Now they ask ‘what did you build this week?’”
